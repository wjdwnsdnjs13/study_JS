			JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]),<br> often abbreviated as JS,<br> is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming<br> language. Along<br>side HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the thre<br>e core<br> technologies of World Wide <br>Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive a<br>nd provide online programs, including video games. T<br>he majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browse<br>rs support it without the need for plug-<br>ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engi<br>ne. Each of the many JavaScript <br>engin<br>es represent a differ<br>ent implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
